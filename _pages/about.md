Hi, I'm Jack, a research student at the Australian National University, working towards a PhD in Robotics.

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mechatronic Engineering from ANU in 2018 and started my PhD in 2019.
 My research is about exploring new techniques and approaches to create better algorithms for multi-vehicle collaborative localisation. If you want to learn more about my research, check out my [Thesis Proposal Review](/publication/2020-thesis-proposal-review).
  
 My research is supervised by [Jochen Trumpf](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~trumpf/) and [Robert Mahony](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~Robert.Mahony/) at the ANU, and is generously supported by [Defence Science and Technology Group](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/).
