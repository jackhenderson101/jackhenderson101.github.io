I am a research student at the Australian National University, working towards a PhD in Robotics.

My area of research is in collaborative localisation for networks of robots, with a specific interest in minimum energy filtering techniques. In layman's terms, I'm trying to find better ways for robots to share information among themselves, so that each of them can get a better idea of where they are in their environment.

My research is supervised by [Jochen Trumpf](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~trumpf/) and [Robert Mahony](https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~Robert.Mahony/) at the ANU, and is supported by [Defence Science and Technology Group](https://www.dst.defence.gov.au/).
