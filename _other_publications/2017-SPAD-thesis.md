abstract: 'We explore the process of visual object tracking on data obtained from Single Photon
Avalanche Diode (SPAD) arrays. The task differs from traditional visual object tracking
due to the unique characteristics of SPAD data, namely high noise and coarse resolution.
The performance of three state-of-the-art visual trackers, STRUCK, KCF, and Meanshift,
is evaluated on a series of synthetic sequences, which are created using statistical models of
supplied SPAD data. Even with the raw SPAD data as the input, the three trackers perform
significantly better than expected, surpassing the performance observed on benchmark
sequences captured with traditional digital cameras. Performance can be further increased
with the introduction of a newly created image feature, which utilises the temporal
characteristics of the SPAD signal. Overall, STRUCK provides the best performance in
terms of accuracy and robustness. Our results demonstrate that visual object tracking
methods are a viable and promising approach to object tracking on SPAD data.'
