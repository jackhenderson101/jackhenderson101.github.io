abstract: 'Current state-of-the-art pose estimation techniques rely on neural network models to
accurately detect, localise and estimate the pose of target objects in a scene. One of
the primary weaknesses in these methods is the difficulty in detecting new target objects
which the network has not been trained on. We propose a new type of neural network
structure which allows for efficient transfer of learning from the training set onto unseen
objects. We identify a lack of existing datasets to suit this type of structure. Based on
this, we formalise a method for a semi-automated process of camera calibration, hand-eye
calibration and capturing of images for the object pose library. We also consider methods
of augmenting the pose library to create a corresponding training set for the target objects.
We demonstrate how to isolate the target object from the background, and a method of
artificially rotating the camera viewpoint. Overall, we provide a foundational process for
creating a new type of dataset, enabling the use of a new structure of neural networks for
pose estimation. We further identify a number of key areas for further development of this
dataset.'
