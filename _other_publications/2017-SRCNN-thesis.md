abstract: 'We explore the application of CNNs to the problem of image super resolution, focussing
on SRCNN. We replicate the implementation and confirm the performance of SRCNN,
showing that simple, 3-layered, fully convolutional network is able to measurably enhance
the level of detail in an image. We extend this network to a multi-frame case, which utilises
the temporal relationship of subsequent video frames to add additional context to the
network. Our experiments demonstrate a clear improvement of the multi-frame network
over the original SRCNN. We also perform a cursory exploration of image alignment and
re-introduction of colour channels with mixed results.'
