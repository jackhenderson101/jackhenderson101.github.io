abstract: 'Accurate localisation of unmanned aerial vehicles is vital for the next generation of automation tasks. This paper proposes a minimum energy filter for velocity-aided pose estimation on the extended special Euclidean group. The approach taken exploits the Lie-group symmetry of the problem to combine Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor output with landmark measurements into a robust and high performance state estimate. We propose an asynchronous discrete-time implementation to fuse high bandwidth IMU with low bandwidth discrete-time landmark measurements typical of real-world scenarios. The filter''s performance is demonstrated by simulation.'
